If you've got write access to the [aucklug/aucklug.github.com repository on GitHub][1], you can edit this website. It is built upon [Jekyll][2], a 
static site generator written in Ruby which powers thousands of websites, including many of [pages.github.com][3]. There's three ways to contribute content:

* Item 1
+ sub item 1
* Item2
+ sub item 2

* Item 3
* Item 4
